## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis contains salary information for various data professions. It includes the following columns:
- Age
- Gender
- Profession
- Salary
- Date

## Installation

To run the analysis, you need to have R and RStudio installed. You can install the necessary packages using the following commands:

```R
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("lubridate")
install.packages("knitr")
install.packages("rmarkdown")
```

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/salary-eda.git
```

## Analysis

The analysis is conducted using an R Markdown file (`EDA-HTML.Rmd`). The key steps followed in the analysis include:

1. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, correcting data types, and ensuring data consistency.
2. **Descriptive Statistics**: Generating summary statistics to understand the basic properties of the data.
3. **Data Visualization**: Creating various plots to visualize the data and uncover patterns.

### Key Insights

- **Salary Distribution**: Most salaries are concentrated within specific ranges, with notable peaks indicating common salary brackets. Thereâ€™s a slight skew towards higher salaries, suggesting many data professionals occupy higher-paying roles.
- **Salaries vs. Age by Gender**: Consistent salary growth trends were observed across genders with age, although some disparities exist, with males generally earning slightly higher salaries at certain ages.
- **Gender-Based Salary Distribution**: Distinct salary distributions between genders were highlighted. Males tend to have a broader range of salaries, while females are more concentrated in specific brackets.
- **Profession and Gender Representation**: Significant gender disparities exist across professions, pointing to areas needing improved gender balance.
- **Salary Trends Over Time by Gender**: Both genders have seen salary growth over time, but the rate of increase is not uniform. Males typically experience a steeper rise in salaries over time.
- **Average Salaries by Profession**: Significant variations in average salaries were found across professions, emphasizing the impact of profession choice on earning potential.

## Visualizations

The following visualizations were created using ggplot2 to illustrate the key insights:
- **Salary Density Plot**: Visualizes the distribution of salaries across the dataset.
- **Salaries vs. Age by Gender**: Shows how salaries vary with age for different genders.
- **Histogram of Salaries by Gender**: Highlights the salary distribution for each gender.
- **Counts of Employees by Profession and Gender**: Displays the representation of different genders across professions.
- **Salary Trends Over Time by Gender**: Plots the salary growth over time for each gender.
- **Lollipop Chart of Salaries by Profession**: Compares the average salaries across different professions.

## Conclusion

This EDA project has been an enlightening journey into understanding salary trends within data professions. By breaking down salary data into meaningful segments and trends, we can now make more informed decisions, promote fair salary practices, and ultimately improve the industry standards.
